{{DISPLAYTITLE:Release Notes}}
<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight:bold;">This page explains how the release management team prepares release notes for Firefox.</p>


== Summarized process ==

== What's the purpose of release notes? ==
Release notes are a central source of information about changes in each Firefox release. They're mainly aimed at advanced and technical users of Firefox who want to be informed about the changes in Firefox's latest updates.

They may be web developers, IT managers who deploy Firefox for their users, or people who need to know all the details of the browser they use to accomplish their work. Technical journalists also follow our release notes in order to write stories on changes in Firefox.

The release notes page lists all the new features, changes or unfixed critical bugs for a specific release of Firefox. Their edition and content are under the responsibility of the release management team.

Examples of past release notes:
* [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox//android/59.0/releasenotes/ Firefox 59 for Android]
* [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/59.0/releasenotes/ Firefox 59 for Desktop]
* [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/60.0beta/releasenotes/ Firefox 60 Beta for Desktop]
* [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/61.0a1/releasenotes/ Firefox Nightly 61 for Desktop]

Here is the full list of [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/releases/ past Firefox release notes].

The release notes for the beta and release channels are published at the day we ship Firefox or Firefox Beta to our users.
Release notes on the Nightly channel are produced continuously during the cycle, as a consequence the notes for Nightly are also available as an [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/nightly/notes/feed/ RSS Feed] to allow testers to be notified when a new note is added to a release.

The ''[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Po9bsZ673yNFRLTGwtRjZGN2s Drafts of release notes]'' Google drive folder contains gdocs of release notes from prevous releases.

The release management team maintains release notes for Firefox Desktop and Firefox for Android only. Release notes for other products are not in our scope at the moment.

== How to decide whether a change should be included in release notes? ==
The changes that should be included in releases notes include:
* New features for end users and web developers
* Important changes for end users and web developers
* Important stability and security fixes
* New locales
* Important system requirements changes (ex: end of support of Windows XP)

== How to nominate a bug for release notes addition ==

 1. '''Nominate a bug'''. Go to a bug in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org Bugzilla], and nominate fixes or changes for release notes. Expand the "Tracking Flags" section. Then please set the relnote-firefox: flag to "?". Release management checks this flag regularly.

A form will pop up in the Bugzilla comments box, asking for your suggested wording for the note and an optional url to link to further documentation.

2. '''Explain the fix'''. If your fix or other project should be in release notes, tell us what it did, what it means, and what the users and tech press should know. Ideally, we link from each note to an MDN page, a blog post hosted somewhere on mozilla.org, or even a wiki page for users to understand changes, fixes, and new features. Details are very useful here.

Here is [https://youtu.be/G6VeZyOP_Rk a short video showing the above process].

== When should you nominate a bug for release notes addition ==

If you think your feature should be added to release notes, it's a good idea to nominate it for addition as soon as it is on the nightly channel.

If your feature is ready for testing on the nightly channel but is behind feature flag as it isn't planned to ship on Beta/Release soon, please nominate it so as that we can expose it to our alpha-testers. The r+ flag will be set by release management only when it ships to beta/release but we have specific release notes for our alpha testers.

== The relnote-firefox tracking flag values ==

==What release managers do for relnotes==

* We check in Bugzilla bugs nominated for release note addition for Nightly and add them to Nightly release notes if necessary
* We watch all commits every day on mozilla-central for features that may be note-worthy. We regularly have features we want to add to release notes that are not nominated for addition in Bugzilla, when it is the case we ping the patch author and ask him to nominate her bug.
* We also ask engineering managers and developer teams to tell us what note-worthy fixes are upcoming for nightly, beta, and release channels.
* We check other sources like the [https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org Nightly blog] or the [https://hacks.mozilla.org Hacks blog] to find notable new work.
* In every release cycle, relman asks people on several engineering mailing lists to read release note drafts, review them, and suggest changes.

==Nucleus: our publishing tool==

Release notes are written and managed in [https://nucleus.mozilla.org Nucleus].

Notable fixes and detailed new features for web developers can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases.

Release management may also skim through the entire list of fixed bugs for a release to find possible release notes. That's often around 4000 bugs! (List of fixed bugs for the [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=target_milestone&f2=cf_status_firefox{{RELEASE_VERSION}}&j_top=OR&list_id=12572116&o1=substring&o2=anywordssubstr&product=Core&product=Firefox&product=Firefox%20for%20Android&product=Firefox%20for%20iOS&product=Hello%20%28Loop%29&product=Toolkit&query_format=advanced&v1={{RELEASE_VERSION}}&v2=fixed%2C%20verified&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&limit=0 current release]; for [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=target_milestone&f2=cf_status_firefox{{BETA_VERSION}}&j_top=OR&list_id=12572116&o1=substring&o2=anywordssubstr&product=Core&product=Firefox&product=Firefox%20for%20Android&product=Firefox%20for%20iOS&product=Hello%20%28Loop%29&product=Toolkit&query_format=advanced&v1={{BETA_VERSION}}&v2=fixed%2C%20verified&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&limit=0 beta]; for [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=target_milestone&f2=cf_status_firefox{{CENTRAL_VERSION}}&j_top=OR&list_id=12572116&o1=substring&o2=anywordssubstr&product=Core&product=Firefox&product=Firefox%20for%20Android&product=Firefox%20for%20iOS&product=Hello%20%28Loop%29&product=Toolkit&query_format=advanced&v1={{CENTRAL_VERSION}}&v2=fixed%2C%20verified&order=bug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&limit=0 nightly].)

==Nightly and Beta Cycles==

For the first aurora release, from the nucleus interface:
* Create a new aurora release
* Copy the requirements and description from the previous aurora release
* Make sure that is_public is disabled
* Ask for review to the various relevant teams (the list is available in the Release Team Calendar)
* Enable is_public on the aurora release day

For the first beta release, from the nucleus interface:
* Copy the nightly release (is_public is going to be disabled)
** Use the checkbox in the releases list, then the dropdown, to copy it.
* Update the title
* Update the date
* Update the description text (since the Nightly text links to information about what Developer Edition is)
* Ask for review (cf night)
* Enable is_public on the beta release day

During the nightly/beta cycle:
* Scan the relnote-firefox "?" flags
* Try to find some important unresolved bugs
* Check if some features have not been disabled

==Release==
* Same step as Beta
* Once the notes have been signed off and the release is live, ''is_public'' has to be turned on.

==Product details==
For the links in the Firefox download pages to point to the correct associated release notes, you will next need to update [[Release Management/Product_details|product details]].

== Best practices for writing release notes ==
* Web Developer Release Notes are now added as one note and then point directly to MDN for that release (Example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/49#Changes_for_Web_developers).
* All URLs in relnotes should be de-localized. Typically this means removing the 'en-US/' portion of the URL.
* A relnote that applies to both desktop and android should be written once and associated with both releases.
* Don't link to bugs in the note.
* Relnotes are sentence fragments. Don't start them with 'The', 'A', etc. Don't use periods.
* Keep relnotes as short as possible. If you find yourself wanting to start a new sentence, figure out a way to rephrase the note.
* Do not use abbreviations. For example, "pref" should be "preference".
* Group items that belong to a category together. For example, items with WebRTC can be grouped together.
* "Developer" tag is for "Developer Tools".
* Get the release notes ready for review by requesting feedback across Mozilla. The audience reviewing this includes RelMan, release-drivers, fx-team, front-end team, SUMO team, platform-devs, QE, etc. Please follow up and close on the review feedback comments promptly.
