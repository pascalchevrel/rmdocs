During the Nightly development cycle, release managers should do the following:

* Check for bugs nominated for tracking
* File top crashes and newly appearing crashes from crash-stats
* Find owners for tracked bugs. This is important as it gives us a chance to fix new regressions and crashes before they move to channels which have more users.
* Track bugs related to new feature development that are aimed for their release.
** Look for new features at the planning meeting, by asking engineering and product managers, and by spotting heavy activity in meta bugs
* Check for what's new pages and get them to localizers (see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Aurora_Landing_Process#A_few_days_before_the_merge_day)
* Write release notes towards the end of the cycle for mobile and desktop versions.
