== Release timeline ==

Firefox is released at intervals of six to eight weeks (not counting urgent patch updates), meaning that every six to eight weeks there
will be a new version of Firefox Release.

=== From mozilla-central to mozilla-release ===
* Firefox Nightly is released every 12 hours with all the changes landed on mozilla-central
* Every 6 to 8 weeks, we merge the code from mozilla-central to our mozilla-beta branch. The mozilla-beta branch should now only get patches aimed at stabilizing the release. Any patch on mozilla-central that we want backported to our mozilla-beta branch should follow the [[Release_Management/Uplift_rules|approval rules for uplifts]]
* Beta 1 and Beta 2 are built from this beta branch and used to build and ship Firefox Developer Edition as a stabilization step before shipping Firefox Beta to our much wider Beta audience.
* Starting with Beta 3, Firefox Beta is released twice a week for Desktop, leaving us with 12 to 16 betas every cycle unless we have chemspills leading to additional betas. Firefox Beta 3 is shipped to a subset of our Beta population. The full Beta population gets updated starting with beta 4 only.
* At the end of the Beta cycle, a final build is validated by our QA and tagged for release into the mozilla-release branch

=== Android specificities ===
* Firefox Nightly is released every 24 hours
* Starting with Beta 3, Firefox Beta is released once a week for Android, leaving us with 6 to 9 betas every cycle.

Release day activities/checklist can be found on the [[Release_Management/Release_Day|Release Day wiki page]]

Our release schedule is meant to be flexible and we may occasionally modify the length of a cycle to be shorter or longer than the 6-8 week cycle mentioned. Check the [https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar '''Rapid Release Calendar'''] to stay updated with the upcoming branch dates.

== All about Flags  ==
[[File:Status.png|400px|right]]
* '''tracking-firefoxN''' : A multi-state flag that currently has two values which show whether a  bug is being investigated for possible resolution in the FirefoxN release . Bugs marked tracking-firefoxN are bugs that must be resolved  one way or another before a particular release ships. [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Drivers Release drivers] will track and shepherd the bug until it is determined the bug no longer impacts the release
** ?  This bug has been nominated to block FirefoxN
** - (minus) - Drivers have determined this bug will not block FirefoxN
** + (plus) -  Drivers have determined this bug will block the FirefoxN release or may be tracked after the FirefoxN release

Refer to [https://blog.mozilla.org/channels/2011/06/01/more-details-about-how-to-use-the-tracking-firefox-bugzilla-flag/ these guidelines] on setting the tracking flag

== The Process ==


1) If you think a bug needs to be addressed in a release :
* Set the '''tracking-firefoxN : ?''' nomination on a bug for with helpful justification and keeping these [https://blog.mozilla.org/channels/2011/06/01/more-details-about-how-to-use-the-tracking-firefox-bugzilla-flag/ guidelines] in mind
* Mark the corresponding status flag as affected if the patch is still being worked on
* Once the patch is ready set the approval flag appropriately depending on which branches are affected

2) Members of Release Management go through all the bugs nominated for tracking & if in agreement that this bug needs to be investigated in that release we will go ahead and set '''tracking-firefoxN : +''' . Once we track a bug for a particular release we will make sure to follow-up on the progress or help with any road blockers till you have a patch nominated for approval

'''Note :''' Bugs denied for tracking-firefoxN are still important .It merely means based on the information we have now,we do not feel the bug would prevent us from shipping a release. If new information comes to light, you need help getting more data before you can make the case for us to track, or you disagree with our assessment feel free to renominate again with additional justification

3) Once you nominated a patch with '''approval-mozilla-beta/release : ?''' we will evaluate the information given in the attachment request we may either approve/deny/request more information. Once you get an approval , i.e '''approval-mozilla-beta/release : +''' , please go ahead with landing on the corresponding branch and mark status-firefoxN flag to "fixed" , making sure [https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ Treeherder] is green

=== Nag Emails ===
* To ensure that these tracking Bugs get the needed attention and keeping in mind the deadlines in case you forget Release Management sends you friendly nag emails for these blocker email's to make sure these get the needed priority and attention as they are are considered potential blockers for release
* If you are working on a tracked bug you may have seen emails with Subject similar to : '''''RelMan Attention Needed: Monday May 20 -- Daily Release Tracking Alert''''' for bugs that are actively not being worked on or if any of the bugs may have a '''needsinfo''' on you and is blocking progress
* This has also been very helpful to avoid any communication gap between Release drivers and developers and help us be on the same page and setting the right expectation about a tracked bugs progress and resolution
